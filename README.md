# Rock-Paper-Scissor
This is an implementation of Rock Paper Scissor game which can be played via terminal.
I have used the random library of C++ to generate random numbers.
These random numbers are set to be generated from 1 - 3.
We allow the system to choose its own choice with this random number and check who Won!.
